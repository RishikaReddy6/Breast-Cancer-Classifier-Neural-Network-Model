# Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Networks  

## Overview  

Early detection of breast cancer is critical for improving patient outcomes. This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using neural networks. By utilizing a well-structured dataset and advanced machine learning methodologies, the model aims to provide high accuracy in classification.  

## Features  

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
  The dataset consists of features extracted from breast cancer cell images, including **cell size, shape, and texture**. The data undergoes cleaning and transformation to ensure optimal performance during training.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization**  
  Various data visualization techniques, including histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots, are employed to gain insights into feature distributions and differences between malignant and benign tumors.  

- **Neural Network Model**  
  A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network is implemented to learn complex patterns in the data, allowing for accurate classification. The architecture includes **multiple hidden layers, activation functions, and optimization techniques** to enhance model performance.  

- **Model Evaluation**  
  The model is assessed using standard evaluation metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**. Additionally, confusion matrices are used to visualize the classification results.  

## Why This Project?  

Breast cancer diagnosis often relies on **biopsy and imaging techniques**, which can be time-consuming. Machine learning and deep learning offer **a data-driven approach** to assist medical professionals in faster and more reliable diagnoses. This project aims to bridge the gap between healthcare and AI-driven solutions.
